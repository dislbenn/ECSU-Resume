            Hello, my name is Disaiah Bennett, and I am a senior at Elizabeth City State University (ECSU).
            I am a computer science major, with a scientific concentration and a minor in mathematics.
            Throughout my time at ECSU, I have attended multiple conferences, internships, and a hackathan.<br><br>

            My first internship was at Indiana University, in Bloomington, Indiana, in the summer of 2017. The  
            internship was focused in the field of cyber security, where I constructed an Returned Oriented
            Programming (ROP) attack against Intel SGX. The attack was designed to find any bug or exploit within
            the SGX provided by Intel and report any information that could become a security hazard.<br><br>

            After constructing the bug, we launched the attack against the SGX; however, the bug was intercepted
            before the attack could make it within the system. By running multiple test with the malware hidden
            within a payload, the bug would force the CPU to throw a segmentation fault. This prevented the user from
            accessing a location they were not given access to.

            In the fall of 2017, I attended the IBM HBCU BlueHack Atlanta Hackathan. I was selected, along with
            six other students from my university to represent ECSU. With the experience and skills we obtained from
            the university, we were able to produce a product, that would allow all of us to place third at the competition.<br><br>
            
            The product we created was a web application known as Medical Doctor 4 Me, or MD4Me. By accessing the product,
            customers that were in need of a therapeutic session, could access the system and engage with an artifical
            therapist. The AI is able to self learn and adapt base on the feedback recevied by the customers, and report
            the session to a professionals based on the amount of negative keywords detected.
